# PDF to MP3 Converter
This is a simple python text-to-audio program. I got tired of not being able to find a free solution online to have my pdfs read to me.
Future goals will be to simplfy the upload process as well as add UI for voice and speed options.
This is built on the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Python library and CLI tool (gTTS).
